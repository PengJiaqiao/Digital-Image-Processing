# DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING
## Introduction

Participants learn basic concepts, their theoretical foundation, and the most common algorithms used in digital image processing. After completing the module, participants understand strengths and limitations of different methods, are able to correctly and successfully apply methods and algorithms to real world problems, and are aware of performance criteria

The homework will be programming exercises (C++ & OpenCV) that have to be handled in groups of 3-4 students. Please select below in which group you want to work in. The maximum size of a group is 4 students. Groups with less than 3 members will be merged with other groups after the group selection deadline which is on Thursday, 25.10.2018.

## Environment
Ubuntu 16.04, OpenCV 3.4.3
